# Usage Example ‚å®Ô∏è

After installing **SliceControl**, you should start by importing the framework:

```swift
import SliceControl
```

Once imported, you can start using **SliceControl** like follows:

```swift
sliceControl = SliceControl(with: ["All", "Liked", "Favourited"],
                            primaryColor: .darkGray,
                            secondaryColor: .white,
                            padding: 12)

// Implement SliceControlDelegate to intercept actions
sliceControl.delegate = self

view.addSubview(sliceControl)
// ... Constrain it
```
You can also set its `UIFont` and starting option.
